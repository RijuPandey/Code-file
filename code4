Code and "Explanation" of Majority "Element"

CODE:
class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
       int freq=0;
       int ans=0;
       for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
        if(freq==0){
            ans=nums[i];
        }
        if(ans==nums[i]){
            freq++;
        }
        else{
            freq--;
        }
       } 
       return ans;
    }
}

Approach Explanation:
The algorithm works by maintaining two variables:

ans: This represents the candidate for the majority element.
freq: This tracks how often the candidate has appeared.
Here's how the algorithm progresses:

Initialization:
freq is initialized to 0.
ans is initialized to 0 (or any arbitrary value since it will be replaced later).
Iterating through the array:
For each element in the array (nums[i]), the algorithm checks if freq is 0. If so, it updates the candidate (ans) to the current element (nums[i]).
If the current element matches the candidate (ans), it increments freq, suggesting that the candidate appears again.
If the current element does not match ans, it decrements freq, suggesting that this candidate is losing its majority.
Final result:
By the end of the loop, the value in ans is the majority element. This works because the majority element (appearing more than n/2 times) will always survive through the increments and decrements of freq.


Time Complexity
The algorithm only traverses the array once, in a single for loop.
Each iteration consists of a constant number of operations (checking conditions, updating variables), so the time complexity is proportional to the number of elements in the array, n.
Thus, the time complexity is:

O(n), where n is the size of the input array nums.

Space Complexity:
The algorithm uses a fixed amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the input array:
freq and ans are both integer variables.
No additional data structures (like arrays or hashmaps) are used.
